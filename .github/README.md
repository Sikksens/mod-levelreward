# Features
This module will send gold to players when they reaching certain levels. It can also send an item to the player.

The amount of gold and the rewarded item can be changed using the configuration options as well as the text inside the mail.

It's possible for the the mail to be sent from a specific creature, identified by the entry specified in the `creature_template` table of the world database.
